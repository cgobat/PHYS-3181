Homework 10 code assignment

Author: Caden Gobat

To compile, call "gcc -o pde hw10.c". This produces an executable called pde.

hw10.c is based on the Gauss-Seidel routine we've been studying in class, and contains code to numerically solve the Laplace equation in 2 dimensions.
It prints out the results of the computation, the number of iterations it took to reach the desired precision, and the result of the flux integral.
As command-line inputs, it takes the # of points/nodes per side of the box (N) and the desired precision/tolerance (Î´).

For example, it could be run by calling "./pde 20 0.01" from a command line.
This will set create a 20x20 point square, and run the solver until the precision is within 0.01.
