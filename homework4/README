Uses Runge-Kutta integration to simulate gravitational interaction between an arbitrary number of bodies in space based on parameters specified from the command line.
It can be compiled using "gcc Nbody_integrator.c -o Nbody". This produces an executable called Nbody

To run, call "./Nbody dt tmax m1 x1 y1 vx1 vy1 m2 x2 y2 vx2 vy2 m3 x3 y3 vx3 vy3" from a command line, where the variable names should be replaced by your parameter values of choice:
    m1, m2, and m3 are the masses of the bodies in units of solar mass
    x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, and y3 are the initial positions in units of AU
    vx1, vy1, vx2, vy2, vx3, and vy3 are the initial velocity components in units of AU/year
    dt is the time step size to use
    tmax is the total time over which to run
