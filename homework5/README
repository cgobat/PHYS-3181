The code in resistorgrid.c computes the equivalent resistance between two vertices (located at x1,y1 and x2,y2) of an NxN grid of 1 Ohm resistors.
It can be compiled using "gcc -o computeresistance resistorgrid.c linalgebra.c". This will produce an executable called computeresistance.
The linalgebra.c source file and the linalgebra.h header file should be in the same directory, as they include linear algebra helper functions that the main code relies on.

To run, call "./computeresistance N x1 y1 x2 y2" from the command line, where the variable names should be replaced by the user's parameter values of choice.
