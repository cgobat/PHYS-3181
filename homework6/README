Homework 6 code assignment

To compile, call "gcc -o fit fit.c linalgebra.c". This produces an executable called fit

fit.c contains code to read and fit data from a file where each line is of the form <independent var> <dependent variable> <error>.
As coded now, it takes the filename and the number of lines from the file to read as command-line arguments.

For example, it can be run by calling "./fit cannonball.dat 13" from a command line, which fits the data contained in the first 13 lines of cannonball.dat

The order of the polynomial is currently set to 2, but can be easily altered by changing the #define near the top of the code.

The code outputs the chi-squared values, as well as the coefficients of the polynomial, which can then be used to plot the function in Mathematica and compare it to the data.
